# BACKEND

### Contents:

The BACKEND was constructed using the [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) client and tool [MySQLWorkbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).

### Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-workbench
```

### Usage:
Before running the DB Schema code, make sure you have downloaded the [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) app and module MySQL is running.
Then, in MySQLWorkbench, run file [DBSchema.sql], which constructs the DB.

Database `mydb` is now constructed and can be filled with data (see [generate_data] folder).
